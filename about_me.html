		My Name is Brian Shaw and I and a worker, student, dad, ect...
		</p>
		<p>
		I guess you're here because you want to know a bit more about me, huh? I'm not all that great at talking about myself, but I'll give it a shot.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm currently working as an IT Project Manager.  I like the job but I sort of feel like I'm just playing telephone between the business and IT.  I wish I was in more of a technical role, which is why I'm going back to school to get a Computer Science degree.  I'm working full time, so I don't have a lot of time for school, so I am just taking a class a semester.  It's slow going but it is nice to know that I am plugging away at my degree.  I'm also a new father.  I have a 8 month old son named William.  My wife an I's life has changed quite a bit, but we are loving it and learning new things every day.
